I'm a web guy who works for social good. When I'm not working in the nonprofit sector, I'm organizing politically, both online and in person.

I was born near Seattle, but I've moved all over, including Michigan, New York, and now California.

I've studied political science as an undergrad and journalism as a grad student, but it's the web that really attracts me: specifically, communicating necessary information to people with as little friction as possible.
